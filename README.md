# Simple Gallery Web Page

This repository contains a simple gallery web page created with HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic design where users can view images in a gallery but cannot perform any interactive operations.



## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the gallery. The images are static, and there are no interactive features.

## Contributing

This project is intended for demonstration purposes and is not actively seeking contributions. Feel free to fork the repository if you want to modify or extend it for your own purposes.
