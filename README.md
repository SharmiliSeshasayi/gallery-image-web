Certainly! Here is an example README file text that you can use for your GitHub repository:

```markdown
# Simple Gallery Web Page

This repository contains a simple gallery web page created with HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic design where users can view images in a gallery but cannot perform any interactive operations.

## Preview

![Gallery Preview](screenshot.png)

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the gallery. The images are static, and there are no interactive features.

## Contributing

This project is intended for demonstration purposes and is not actively seeking contributions. Feel free to fork the repository if you want to modify or extend it for your own purposes.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
```

Make sure to replace `screenshot.png` with the actual filename of your gallery preview screenshot. You can take a screenshot of your gallery web page and save it as `screenshot.png` or any other preferred image format.

Remember to include the actual license file (`LICENSE`) if you choose to use a specific license. In this example, I used the MIT License, but you can choose a license that fits your preferences and needs.
